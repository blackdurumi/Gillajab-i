# Installation
If you want to build this app, then
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is the basic requirements for running Gillajab-i.

Currently, the dependencies of python-mecab-ko and the g2pk module for Pororo is a bit shaky,
So we advise to add the mecab/dic/mecab-ko-dic folder (in our repository) to your local
env/lib folder.

**DO NOT** add the mecab folder to env/lib/python, but add it to the env/lib folder.
