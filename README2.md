## What is Gillajab-i, and why did we make it?

Gillajab-i is a program that helps a non-native Korean in perfecting his/her Korean Pronunciation. Due to the steep popularity rise in K-Pop and all things Korean, the number of non-native Korean learners are at record high. So in order to help these Korean learners, kids from none other than Korea University made this app to help learners prefect their Korean through CAPT (Computer Aided Pronunciation Training).
